# Prototype-JS

Card layout with small cues for functionality.

## Overview

Conceptually the user can view a list of items in its entirety. User has the ability
to add an item to the cart with a small cue giving them confirmation of the addition
and badging to allow for more feedback.

Image and category areas within the card can allow the user to expand the cards potential.

Search bar (though non-functional) could provide quick access to items easier

Menu bar allows user to do more with what is visible to them currently.

## Things to consider (wants/needs)

Since I did utilize a given API list of items I think I would prefer to have
a true API that I could hit to give a lazy load type of approach. It would give the
user a sense of something is happening.

The api utilized didn't have images that scaled very well. I think if I were to do it again
I'd prefer to have images that had more size variations
to allow for better usage of responsiveness for how the cards/list would render.

I feel like there should be an entensive filter component that lives either between
the Logo and Search bar OR is a fixed left side bar. There are so many factors
here it isn't quite a simple throw something in and see how it goes due to the nature of
this type of layout.

I did do a very basic approach in the menu dropdown that takes the data that came in and creates a
list of categories based on that data-set. If fleshed out further the concept would allow the
user to select a category and it would filter the list down and close the drawer at the same time.
Do I like this current layout? Not quite, but it is more to give whomever is looking at this
the understanding that I am thinking about that.

So many more things I could discuss about this but I do hope this provides the needed input
to showcase code knowledge and basic layout understanding. Again, this type of layout or concept
is not new but has morphed a ton over the past 2yrs. To say I have come even close to what
is possible for this type of layout - I barely scratched the surface.
